>Using Table 4.12(p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:
```cpp
* vec.begin()  // *(vec.begin())
*vec.begin()+1  // (*(vec.begin()))+1

>Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

No. It is more error-prone.
